## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Can't connect from phone/other device?

**Most likely:** Windows Firewall is blocking port 5001

**Solution:** Run `START_SERVER.bat` as Administrator (right-click)

### ‚ùå Port already in use?

Another app is using port 5001. Check what's using it:
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :5001
```

### ‚ùå Server won't start?

1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### ‚ùå IP shows 127.0.0.1?

You're not connected to a network. Connect to Wi-Fi or Ethernet and restart.
