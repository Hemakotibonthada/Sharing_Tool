## 📱 What You Should See in Browser:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│     NetShare Pro - Login Page      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│  Username: [_______________]        │
│                                     │
│  Password: [_______________]        │
│                                     │

│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Default Login:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

## 🔍 Understanding the 401 Responses

The 401 responses you see are **normal and expected**:

```python
# This is the health check code from desktop_app.py
def open_browser(port, max_attempts=30):
    for i in range(max_attempts):
        try:
            # Tries to connect to check if server is ready
            sock.connect_ex(('127.0.0.1', port))
            # Server responds with 401 because no auth token
            # This is correct - it means server is responding!
        except:
            pass
        time.sleep(0.5)
    
    # Once server is confirmed responding, open browser
    webbrowser.open(url)
```

**Why 401?**
- The health check accesses the root URL `/`
- The root URL requires authentication
- No auth token = 401 Unauthorized
- **This confirms the server is working correctly!**

## 🎯 What to Do Now:

### 1. Check Your Browser
- Browser window should have opened automatically
- If not, manually visit: `http://127.0.0.1:5001`

### 2. Login
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

### 3. Change Password
- After login, go to **Settings** → **Change Password**
- Set a strong password

### 4. Start Using!
- Upload files
- Create users
- Share with your team

---

## 🛑 To Stop the Server:

Press `Ctrl+C` in the PowerShell window

---

## 🚀 Optional: Install Native Window Support

For a better experience (native window instead of browser tab):

### Option 1: PyQt5 (Best for Windows)
```powershell
pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine
```

### Option 2: pywebview (Lightweight)
```powershell
pip install pywebview
```

After installing, restart the app:
```powershell
python desktop_app.py
```

It will now open in a native window instead of browser!

- ✅ Server started successfully
- ✅ Running on correct port (5001)
- ✅ Health checks working (401 responses)
