# Enhanced Download Features

## Overview
The file sharing application now includes advanced download capabilities with progress tracking, resume functionality, and speed monitoring.

## Features

### 1. **Real-time Progress Display**
- **Percentage**: Shows exact download progress (e.g., 45.2%)
- **Speed**: Displays current download speed (e.g., 2.5 MB/s)
- **Size**: Shows downloaded vs total size (e.g., 45 MB / 100 MB)

### 2. **Pause & Resume**
- Click the **Pause** button to temporarily stop a download
- Progress is saved in memory and localStorage
- Click **Resume** to continue from where you left off
- Works even after page refresh (localStorage persistence)

### 3. **Resume Interrupted Downloads**
- If a download fails due to network issues, it can be resumed
- The system automatically saves progress
- A **Resume** button appears on failed downloads
- Uses HTTP Range requests to continue from the last byte

### 4. **Download Management**
- **Cancel** button to abort downloads completely
- Progress panel appears in bottom-right corner
- Multiple downloads can run simultaneously
- Smooth animations and visual feedback

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (script.js)
- **downloadFileWithProgress()**: Main download function with Range header support
- **showDownloadProgress()**: Creates progress UI with pause/resume buttons
- **updateDownloadProgress()**: Updates progress bar, percentage, speed, and size
- **pauseDownload()**: Saves progress and shows resume button
- **cancelDownload()**: Clears all progress data
- **formatBytes()**: Converts bytes to human-readable format (KB, MB, GB)

### Backend (app.py)
- **Range Request Support**: Validates and processes HTTP Range headers
- **/download-progress/<filename>**: Endpoint that supports partial content (206 status)
- Handles resume by reading from specified byte offset

### Data Persistence
- **In-memory**: `downloadProgress` object stores chunks and metadata
- **localStorage**: Saves progress across page reloads
  - Key format: `download_<filename>`
  - Stores: bytesDownloaded, totalSize, timestamp

### Speed Calculation
- Measures bytes downloaded in time intervals (0.5 second intervals)
- Formula: `speed = bytesDiff / timeDiff`
- Updates in real-time during download

## User Experience

### Starting a Download
1. Click download button on any file
2. Progress panel slides in from bottom-right
3. Shows filename, progress bar, percentage, speed, and size

### Pausing
1. Click pause icon during download
2. Status changes to "Paused"
3. Pause button replaced with Resume button
4. Progress saved automatically

### Resuming
1. Click Resume button
2. Download continues from last byte
3. Status shows "Resuming..."
4. Seamlessly continues to 100%

### On Network Failure
1. Error caught automatically
2. Progress preserved
3. Status shows "Interrupted"
4. Resume button available

### Canceling
1. Click X icon any time
2. Progress cleared immediately
3. localStorage cleaned up
4. Panel removed

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with Fetch API and ReadableStream support
- localStorage for cross-session persistence
- HTTP Range request support required on server

## Security Considerations
- Escapes filenames to prevent XSS attacks
- Validates Range headers on server
- Limits localStorage usage (catches quota errors)

## Future Enhancements
- Download queue management
- Parallel chunk downloads for faster speeds
- Download history with re-download option
- Bandwidth throttling controls
- Download scheduling
