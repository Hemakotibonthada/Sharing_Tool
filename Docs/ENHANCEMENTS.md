# NetShare Pro - Performance & Feature Enhancements

## üöÄ Maximum Transfer Speed Optimizations

### Backend Optimizations (app.py)
- **Chunked Streaming**: Implemented 8MB chunk size for file uploads
  - Reads and writes files in 8192 KB chunks instead of loading entire file into memory
  - Significantly reduces memory usage for large files (up to 1TB supported)
  - Enables faster transfer speeds with optimal buffer size

- **Optimized Downloads**: Enhanced send_from_directory with:
  - `conditional=True`: Supports HTTP range requests for resume capability
  - `max_age=0`: Prevents caching issues with frequently updated files

- **Thread-Safe Statistics**: 
  - Added `threading.Lock()` for concurrent transfer tracking
  - Prevents race conditions during simultaneous uploads/downloads

- **Real-Time Speed Calculation**:
  - Calculates upload/download speeds in real-time
  - Returns human-readable speeds (B/s, KB/s, MB/s, GB/s)
  - Tracks active transfers with transfer IDs

### New Backend Endpoints

#### 1. `/bulk-upload` (POST)
- Upload multiple files simultaneously
- Accepts file list via FormData
- Returns aggregate statistics for all uploads

#### 2. `/bulk-download` (POST)
- Download multiple files as a single ZIP archive
- Accepts JSON array of filenames
- Uses in-memory ZIP compression (ZIP_DEFLATED)
- Sends compressed archive reducing transfer time

#### 3. `/file-info/<filename>` (GET)
- Returns detailed file metadata
- Includes MD5 hash for integrity verification
- Provides file size, modification time, type

#### 4. `/transfer-status` (GET)
- Real-time transfer speed monitoring
- Returns current upload/download speeds
- Lists active transfer IDs

#### 5. `/clear-all` (POST)
- Bulk delete all files from server
- Resets statistics
- Requires confirmation in UI

## üì¶ Parallel Upload/Download Features

### Frontend Enhancements (script.js)

#### Parallel Upload Queue System
- **MAX_PARALLEL_UPLOADS**: 5 simultaneous uploads
- **Upload Queue Management**:
  - Automatically queues files beyond parallel limit
  - Processes next file when current upload completes
  - Maintains upload order

- **Real-Time Speed Display**:
  - Shows speed for each uploading file
  - Updates every second with live transfer rate
  - Format: KB/s, MB/s, GB/s based on speed

- **Individual Progress Tracking**:
  - Separate progress bar for each file
  - Percentage completion display
  - Color-coded status (uploading/complete/failed)

#### Bulk Download Functionality
- **Single File**: Direct download
- **Multiple Files**: Automatic ZIP packaging
- **Selection UI**: Checkboxes for file selection
- **Bulk Action Buttons**:
  - Download Selected (disabled when no selection)
  - Delete Selected (disabled when no selection)
  - Clear All (always enabled with confirmation)

## üé® UI/UX Improvements

### New UI Components

#### Bulk Actions Bar
```html
- Download Selected button (with file count)
- Delete Selected button (with file count)
- Clear All button (with warning)
- Selection info (shows "X files selected")
```

#### Enhanced Upload Area
- Updated text: "Up to 5 parallel uploads"
- "Optimized for maximum speed" indicator
- Real-time upload speed per file
- Transfer completion status

#### Upload Queue Display
- Shows all active uploads
- Individual file progress bars
- Transfer speeds for each file
- Success/failure indicators

### Visual Enhancements
- Glass-morphism design for bulk actions bar
- Gradient buttons with hover animations
- Color-coded transfer states:
  - Blue: Uploading
  - Green: Complete
  - Red: Failed
- Smooth transitions and transform effects

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Transfer Speed
- **Chunk Size**: 8MB (optimal for network transfers)

### File Handling
- **Maximum Size**: 1 TB per file
- **Unlimited Files**: No limit on total file count
- **Bulk Operations**: Process multiple files in single request
- **Integrity Check**: MD5 hashing for verification

2. Upload files in batches (leverage parallel uploads)
3. Use bulk download for multiple files (ZIP compression)
4. Keep files on SSD for faster disk I/O
5. Close other network-intensive applications

### For Large Files (> 1GB)
1. Chunked upload automatically handles memory
2. Monitor transfer status for speed
3. Don't interrupt uploads (no resume yet in UI)
4. Verify integrity using file info after upload
