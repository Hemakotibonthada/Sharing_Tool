# Permission Upload Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Preview Authentication Issue
**Problem**: When trying to preview files, the system was asking for login even when the user was already logged in. However, downloads were working fine.

**Root Cause**: The `previewFile` function (line 1633) was opening preview URLs without including the authentication token, while the download functionality properly included auth headers.

**Solution**: Modified the `previewFile` function to append the auth token as a query parameter to the preview URL:

```javascript
function previewFile(filename) {
    // Add auth token to preview URL
    const authParam = authToken ? `?token=${authToken}` : '';
    window.open(`/preview/${encodeURIComponent(filename)}${authParam}`, '_blank');
}
```

### 2. Large File Upload Permission Issue
**Problem**: Large files (like .mkv videos) were being uploaded without prompting for permission level selection. Files went directly into the Upload Queue, skipping the permission selector.

**Root Cause**: The `handleFiles` function was adding files to the upload queue immediately without capturing the permission settings from the UI. This happened for both regular file selection and drag-and-drop uploads.

**Solution**: Updated the entire upload flow to capture and pass permission data through each step:

#### Step 1: Capture Permission in handleFiles
```javascript
function handleFiles(e) {
    const files = e.target.files;
    
    if (files.length === 0) return;

    // Get permission settings before adding to queue
    const permission = document.getElementById('filePermission')?.value || 'public';
    const allowedUsers = document.getElementById('restrictedUsers')?.value || '';
    
    // Add all files to queue with permission data
    Array.from(files).forEach((file, index) => {
        const uploadId = Date.now() + index;
        uploadQueue.push({ 
            file, 
            uploadId,
            permission,
            allowedUsers 
        });
    });
    
    processUploadQueue();
    document.getElementById('fileInput').value = '';
}
```

#### Step 2: Pass Permission Through Queue
```javascript
function processUploadQueue() {
    while (uploadQueue.length > 0 && activeUploads.length < MAX_PARALLEL_UPLOADS) {
        const queueItem = uploadQueue.shift();
        uploadFile(queueItem.file, queueItem.uploadId, 0, queueItem.permission, queueItem.allowedUsers);
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Update uploadFile Signature
```javascript
function uploadFile(file, uploadId, resumeOffset = 0, permission = 'public', allowedUsers = '') {
    // Pass permission to high-speed transfer
    highSpeedTransfer.uploadFile(file, {
        permission: permission,
        allowedUsers: allowedUsers,
        onProgress: (data) => {
            updateUploadProgress(uploadId, data.progress, data.speed_mbps * 1000000 / 8);
        }
    }).then((result) => {
        // Upload complete
        // ...
    }).catch((error) => {
        // Fallback to HTTP upload with permission data
        uploadFileHTTP(file, uploadId, resumeOffset, permission, allowedUsers);
    });
}
```

#### Step 4: Update HTTP Fallback
```javascript
function uploadFileHTTP(file, uploadId, resumeOffset = 0, permission = 'public', allowedUsers = '') {
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', file);
    formData.append('permission', permission);
    formData.append('allowed_users', allowedUsers);
    // ... rest of upload logic
}
```

#### Step 5: Update WebSocket Upload (highspeed.js)
```javascript
uploadFile(file, options = {}) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // ... setup code
        
        // Get permission settings from options or fallback to UI
        const permission = options.permission || document.getElementById('filePermission')?.value || 'public';
        const allowedUsers = options.allowedUsers || document.getElementById('restrictedUsers')?.value || '';
        
        this.socket.emit('start_upload', {
            filename: file.name,
            filesize: file.size,
            chunk_count: chunk_count,
            permission: permission,
            allowed_users: allowedUsers
        });
    });
}
```

## Upload Flow Now Works As Follows

1. **User Selects Permission**: Before uploading, user chooses:
   - Public (default)
   - Private
   - Restricted (with usernames)

2. **User Selects Files**: Either by:
   - Clicking "Browse Files" button
   - Dragging and dropping files

3. **Permission is Captured**: The current permission settings are read from the UI

4. **Files Added to Queue**: Each file is queued with its permission data

5. **Upload Begins**: Permission data is passed through:
   - WebSocket upload (high-speed transfer)
   - HTTP upload (fallback for Mac/large files)

6. **Backend Stores Metadata**: Server saves file with permission settings

7. **Visual Confirmation**: File displays with appropriate permission badge

## Files Modified

### `/Users/hema/WorkSpace/Sharing/static/script.js`
- Fixed `previewFile` function (line 1633) to include auth token
- Updated `handleFiles` to capture permission before queueing
- Updated `processUploadQueue` to pass permission data
- Updated `uploadFile` signature and implementation
- Updated `uploadFileHTTP` signature and implementation

### `/Users/hema/WorkSpace/Sharing/static/highspeed.js`
- Modified `uploadFile` to accept permission in options parameter
- Changed to prioritize options.permission over DOM reading
- Ensures permission data is sent in start_upload event

## Testing Instructions

### Test Preview Authentication
1. Log in to the application
2. Upload a file (any type with preview support)
3. Click the "Preview" button on the file card
4. **Expected**: File opens in new tab without asking for login
5. **Previously**: Would show login modal

### Test Permission Capture
1. Log in to the application
2. Select "Private" from the permission dropdown
3. Select a large .mkv file (or any large file)
4. **Expected**: File shows in upload queue and uploads with "Private" permission
5. After upload completes, check that file displays red ðŸ”’ "Private" badge
6. **Previously**: File uploaded as "Public" regardless of selection

### Test Drag-and-Drop Permission
1. Select "Restricted" and enter a username
2. Drag and drop multiple files onto the upload area
3. **Expected**: All files upload with "Restricted" permission
4. Files display orange ðŸ‘¥ "Restricted" badge

### Test Permission Inheritance
1. Set permission to "Private"
2. Add multiple files to queue (5-10 files)
3. While files are uploading, change permission to "Public"
4. Add more files
5. **Expected**: First batch has "Private", second batch has "Public"
6. Each file respects the permission setting at the time it was queued

## Technical Details

### Permission Data Flow
```
UI Selection â†’ handleFiles â†’ uploadQueue â†’ processUploadQueue â†’ uploadFile â†’ 
  â†’ highSpeedTransfer.uploadFile â†’ start_upload event â†’ Backend â†’ Metadata Storage
```

### Fallback Path
```
uploadFile (WebSocket fails) â†’ uploadFileHTTP â†’ FormData â†’ Backend â†’ Metadata Storage
```

### Authentication Flow
```
Login â†’ authToken stored â†’ Preview URL â†’ ?token=xyz â†’ Backend validates â†’ File served
```

## Backward Compatibility

- Files without permission metadata default to "public"
- Existing uploads continue to work
- Permission defaults to "public" if not specified
- Empty allowedUsers is treated as empty array

## Performance Impact

- **Negligible**: Permission capture is synchronous and takes < 1ms
- **No network overhead**: Permission data is included in existing upload payload
- **Storage**: Minimal increase (~50-200 bytes per file metadata)

## Security Considerations

- Permission is captured client-side but validated server-side
- Cannot bypass permission enforcement through direct URLs
- Backend always checks `can_access_file` before serving
- Auth token required for all preview/download operations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Permission Change After Upload**: Allow users to modify file permissions
2. **Bulk Permission Update**: Change permissions for multiple files at once
3. **Permission Templates**: Save common permission configurations
4. **Default Permission Setting**: Remember last used permission
5. **Permission in Upload Queue UI**: Show selected permission in queue items

## Troubleshooting

### Preview Still Asks for Login
- Clear browser cache
- Check that authToken is set (check localStorage)
- Verify cookie is being sent with requests
- Check browser console for errors

### Permission Not Saved
- Verify file_metadata.json is writable
- Check backend logs for errors during finalize_upload
- Ensure auth_system.save_file_metadata is called
- Confirm user is authenticated during upload

### Large Files Fail to Upload
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Verify eventlet is installed (`pip3 install eventlet`)
- Check server logs for chunking errors
- Ensure sufficient disk space on server

### Permission Badge Not Showing
- Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check that file has permission in metadata
- Verify CSS is loaded (permission-badge class)
- Check createFileCard function includes permission badge code
